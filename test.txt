Q: How can new nouns be formed?

New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding.
Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g.
The use of progressive forms in -ing, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common.
Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in my chair), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g.

The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.
Here stress is connected to vowel reduction: in the noun "contract" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel //, but in the verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to //.
