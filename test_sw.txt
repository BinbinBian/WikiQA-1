The easiest way to locate the constellation is to find its two brightest stars Castor and Pollux eastward from the familiar V shaped asterism of Taurus and the three stars of Orions belt.
Gemini is dominated by Castor and Pollux, two bright stars that appear relatively close together, encouraging the mythological link between the constellation and twinship.
In Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Gemini are located in two areas: the White Tiger of the West (, X Fng Bi H) and the Vermillion Bird of the South (, Nn Fng Zh Qu).

Q: How many modern constellations are there today?
It was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century AD astronomer Ptolemy and it remains one of the 87 modern constellations today.
To look at Gemini is to look away from the Milky Way; as a result, there are comparatively few deep-sky objects of note.
Other objects of note are NGC 2129, NGC 2158, NGC 2266, NGC 2331, NGC 2355, and NGC 2395.
In doing so, you are drawing an imaginary line that is relatively close to the ecliptic, a line which intersects Gemini roughly at the midpoint of the constellation, just below Castor and Pollux.
